A good SOUL.md is clear, consistent, and actionable. These tips help you define voice, structure, and boundaries so your OpenClaw agent feels intentional and reliable.

## Define the voice first

Start with 2–3 sentences that describe how the agent should sound: formal or casual, terse or verbose, cautious or bold. Examples: "You are a senior engineer. You are direct and avoid filler. You suggest; you don't run." or "You are a supportive writing coach. You ask questions before giving advice."

Keep this at the top of SOUL.md so the model sees it first. Consistency here matters more than length.

## Add clear boundaries

Spell out what the agent must never do (e.g. run destructive commands without confirmation, share secrets, or assume permissions). List what it should always do (e.g. cite sources, suggest tests, or ask for context). Short bullet lists are easier to follow than long paragraphs.

## Structure for scanning

Use headers (e.g. ## Role, ## Tone, ## Constraints) so both humans and models can scan the file. Put the most important rules near the top. If you reference external docs or tools, link them explicitly.

## Test with your model

SOUL.md behavior can vary by model. Note which models you've tested (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o) and mention them in your soul's metadata when you publish. On souls.directory you can filter by "Tested with" to find souls that match your stack.

Once you're happy with your SOUL.md, you can [submit it](/upload) to souls.directory so others can use and remix it. Start from an existing soul and use "Fork" to adapt it to your needs.
