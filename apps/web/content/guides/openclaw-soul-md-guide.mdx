SOUL.md is the file that defines your OpenClaw agent's personality, tone, and behavior. This guide covers what it is, how to use it, and where to find or write one.

## What is SOUL.md?

SOUL.md is a markdown file that sits in your OpenClaw workspace and tells the agent how to present itself: its voice, priorities, and style. Unlike system prompts that only one model sees, SOUL.md is the persistent "soul" of your agent—what makes it feel like yours.

OpenClaw reads this file when starting or responding, so changing SOUL.md changes how your agent talks, what it emphasizes, and how it helps you.

## Why use a SOUL.md?

Default agents tend to sound generic. A SOUL.md gives you a consistent personality: more direct, more technical, more casual, or more formal. It can define roles (e.g. "senior dev reviewer") and boundaries (e.g. "never run destructive commands without asking").

Using a curated SOUL.md from a directory like [souls.directory](/souls) is the fastest way to get a production-ready personality without writing one from scratch.

## How to install a SOUL.md

1. Install OpenClaw and set up your workspace (see the official OpenClaw docs).
2. Browse [souls.directory](/souls) and pick a soul that fits your use case.
3. Copy the one-command install (e.g. `curl https://souls.directory/api/souls/your-soul-slug.md > ~/.openclaw/workspace/SOUL.md`) and run it in your terminal.
4. Restart or reconfigure OpenClaw so it picks up the new SOUL.md.
