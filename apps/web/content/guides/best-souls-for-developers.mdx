Developers need agents that understand code, respect constraints, and match their workflow. Here's how to find and use the best SOUL.md templates for coding, review, and ops.

## What makes a "developer" soul?

A strong developer SOUL.md is clear about scope (e.g. "focus on correctness and security"), uses a direct tone, and often defines rules like "suggest, don't run" or "prefer minimal, readable changes." Many list compatible models (Claude, GPT-4o, etc.) so you can match your stack.

## Where to find them

souls.directory organizes souls by category and model. For developer-focused templates:

- [Technical souls](/souls?category=technical) — coding, DevOps, security, tooling
- [Browse all souls](/souls) and filter by "Tested with" (e.g. Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o) to match your model
- [Collections](/collections) — e.g. "Developer Companion" starter pack

Use the one-command install on each soul's page to drop SOUL.md into your OpenClaw workspace. You can fork and remix any soul to tailor it to your team.

## Quick picks by use case

- **Code review** — look for souls that emphasize clarity, security, and minimal diff.
- **Debugging** — souls that ask clarifying questions and suggest hypotheses.
- **DevOps / ops** — brief, factual, and cautious about destructive actions.
- **Documentation** — technical writing tone and structure.
